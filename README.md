# portscanner
A tool, that scanns for open ports within a certain range on a target ip. In this repo are two files, one command line based and one with GUI. i tried to compile them using auto-py-to-exe and both of them worked compiled. The scanner scanns for all ports in range and print if they are open or closed. The GUI version might be slower and take longer to show the results because it only shows the results after all the ports are scanned. The GUI version also can export the results as a txt file. I also wrote the programm in java (both commandline based and with GUI) and included them in this repo.
